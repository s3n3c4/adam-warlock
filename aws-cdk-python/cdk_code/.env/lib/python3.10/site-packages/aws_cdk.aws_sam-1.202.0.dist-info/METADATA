<!--BEGIN CFNONLY DISCLAIMER-->

There are no official hand-written ([L2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_lib)) constructs for this service yet. Here are some suggestions on how to proceed:

* Search [Construct Hub for Serverless construct libraries](https://constructs.dev/search?q=serverless)
* Use the automatically generated [L1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_l1_using) constructs, in the same way you would use [the CloudFormation AWS::Serverless resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_Serverless.html) directly.

<!--BEGIN CFNONLY DISCLAIMER-->

There are no hand-written ([L2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_lib)) constructs for this service yet.
However, you can still use the automatically generated [L1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_l1_using) constructs, and use this service exactly as you would using CloudFormation directly.

For more information on the resources and properties available for this service, see the [CloudFormation documentation for AWS::Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_Serverless.html).

(Read the [CDK Contributing Guide](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit an RFC if you are interested in contributing to this construct library.)
