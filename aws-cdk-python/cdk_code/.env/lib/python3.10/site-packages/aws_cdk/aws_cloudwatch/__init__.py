## Metric objects

Metric objects represent a metric that is emitted by AWS services or your own
application, such as `CPUUsage`, `FailureCount` or `Bandwidth`.

Metric objects can be constructed directly or are exposed by resources as
attributes. Resources that expose metrics will have functions that look
like `metricXxx()` which will return a Metric object, initialized with defaults
that make sense.

For example, `lambda.Function` objects have the `fn.metricErrors()` method, which
represents the amount of errors reported by that Lambda function:

```python
# fn: lambda.Function


errors = fn.metric_errors()
```

`Metric` objects can be account and region aware. You can specify `account` and `region` as properties of the metric, or use the `metric.attachTo(Construct)` method. `metric.attachTo()` will automatically copy the `region` and `account` fields of the `Construct`, which can come from anywhere in the Construct tree.

You can also instantiate `Metric` objects to reference any
[published metric](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html)
that's not exposed using a convenience method on the CDK construct.
For example:

```python
hosted_zone = route53.HostedZone(self, "MyHostedZone", zone_name="example.org")
metric = cloudwatch.Metric(
    namespace="AWS/Route53",
    metric_name="DNSQueries",
    dimensions_map={
        "HostedZoneId": hosted_zone.hosted_zone_id
    }
)
```

### Instantiating a new Metric object

If you want to reference a metric that is not yet exposed by an existing construct,
you can instantiate a `Metric` object to represent it. For example:

```python
metric = cloudwatch.Metric(
    namespace="MyNamespace",
    metric_name="MyMetric",
    dimensions_map={
        "ProcessingStep": "Download"
    }
)
```

### Metric Math

Math expressions are supported by instantiating the `MathExpression` class.
For example, a math expression that sums two other metrics looks like this:

```python
# fn: lambda.Function


all_problems = cloudwatch.MathExpression(
    expression="errors + throttles",
    using_metrics={
        "errors": fn.metric_errors(),
        "faults": fn.metric_throttles()
    }
)
```

You can use `MathExpression` objects like any other metric, including using
them in other math expressions:

```python
# fn: lambda.Function
# all_problems: cloudwatch.MathExpression


problem_percentage = cloudwatch.MathExpression(
    expression="(problems / invocations) * 100",
    using_metrics={
        "problems": all_problems,
        "invocations": fn.metric_invocations()
    }
)
```

### Search Expressions

Math expressions also support search expressions. For example, the following
search expression returns all CPUUtilization metrics that it finds, with the
graph showing the Average statistic with an aggregation period of 5 minutes:

```python
cpu_utilization = cloudwatch.MathExpression(
    expression="SEARCH('{AWS/EC2,InstanceId} MetricName=\"CPUUtilization\"', 'Average', 300)",

    # Specifying '' as the label suppresses the default behavior
    # of using the expression as metric label. This is especially appropriate
    # when using expressions that return multiple time series (like SEARCH()
    # or METRICS()), to show the labels of the retrieved metrics only.
    label=""
)
```

Cross-account and cross-region search expressions are also supported. Use
the `searchAccount` and `searchRegion` properties to specify the account
and/or region to evaluate the search expression against.

### Aggregation

To graph or alarm on metrics you must aggregate them first, using a function
like `Average` or a percentile function like `P99`. By default, most Metric objects
returned by CDK libraries will be configured as `Average` over `300 seconds` (5 minutes).
The exception is if the metric represents a count of discrete events, such as
failures. In that case, the Metric object will be configured as `Sum` over `300 seconds`, i.e. it represents the number of times that event occurred over the
time period.

If you want to change the default aggregation of the Metric object (for example,
the function or the period), you can do so by passing additional parameters
to the metric function call:

```python
# fn: lambda.Function


minute_error_rate = fn.metric_errors(
    statistic="avg",
    period=Duration.minutes(1),
    label="Lambda failure rate"
)
```

This function also allows changing the metric label or color (which will be
useful when embedding them in graphs, see below).

> Rates versus Sums
>
> The reason for using `Sum` to count discrete events is that *some* events are
> emitted as either `0` or `1` (for example `Errors` for a Lambda) and some are
> only emitted as `1` (for example `NumberOfMessagesPublished` for an SNS
> topic).
>
> In case `0`-metrics are emitted, it makes sense to take the `Average` of this
> metric: the result will be the fraction of errors over all executions.
>
> If `0`-metrics are not emitted, the `Average` will always be equal to `1`,
> and not be very useful.
>
> In order to simplify the mental model of `Metric` objects, we default to
> aggregating using `Sum`, which will be the same for both metrics types. If you
> happen to know the Metric you want to alarm on makes sense as a rate
> (`Average`) you can always choose to change the statistic.

### Labels

Metric labels are displayed in the legend of graphs that include the metrics.

You can use [dynamic labels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html)
to show summary information about the displayed time series
in the legend. For example, if you use:

```python
# fn: lambda.Function


minute_error_rate = fn.metric_errors(
    statistic="sum",
    period=Duration.hours(1),

    # Show the maximum hourly error count in the legend
    label="[max: ${MAX}] Lambda failure rate"
)
```

As the metric label, the maximum value in the visible range will
be shown next to the time series name in the graph's legend.

If the metric is a math expression producing more than one time series, the
maximum will be individually calculated and shown for each time series produce
by the math expression.

## Alarms

Alarms can be created on metrics in one of two ways. Either create an `Alarm`
object, passing the `Metric` object to set the alarm on:

```python
# fn: lambda.Function


cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "Alarm",
    metric=fn.metric_errors(),
    threshold=100,
    evaluation_periods=2
)
```

Alternatively, you can call `metric.createAlarm()`:

```python
# fn: lambda.Function


fn.metric_errors().create_alarm(self, "Alarm",
    threshold=100,
    evaluation_periods=2
)
```

The most important properties to set while creating an Alarms are:

* `threshold`: the value to compare the metric against.
* `comparisonOperator`: the comparison operation to use, defaults to `metric >= threshold`.
* `evaluationPeriods`: how many consecutive periods the metric has to be
  breaching the the threshold for the alarm to trigger.

To create a cross-account alarm, make sure you have enabled [cross-account functionality](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Cross-Account-Cross-Region.html) in CloudWatch. Then, set the `account` property in the `Metric` object either manually or via the `metric.attachTo()` method.

### Alarm Actions

To add actions to an alarm, use the integration classes from the
`@aws-cdk/aws-cloudwatch-actions` package. For example, to post a message to
an SNS topic when an alarm breaches, do the following:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_cloudwatch_actions as cw_actions
# alarm: cloudwatch.Alarm


topic = sns.Topic(self, "Topic")
alarm.add_alarm_action(cw_actions.SnsAction(topic))
```

#### Notification formats

Alarms can be created in one of two "formats":

* With "top-level parameters" (these are the classic style of CloudWatch Alarms).
* With a list of metrics specifications (these are the modern style of CloudWatch Alarms).

For backwards compatibility, CDK will try to create classic, top-level CloudWatch alarms
as much as possible, unless you are using features that cannot be expressed in that format.
Features that require the new-style alarm format are:

* Metric math
* Cross-account metrics
* Labels

The difference between these two does not impact the functionality of the alarm
in any way, *except* that the format of the notifications the Alarm generates is
different between them. This affects both the notifications sent out over SNS,
as well as the EventBridge events generated by this Alarm. If you are writing
code to consume these notifications, be sure to handle both formats.

### Composite Alarms

[Composite Alarms](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/amazon-cloudwatch-now-allows-you-to-combine-multiple-alarms/)
can be created from existing Alarm resources.

```python
# alarm1: cloudwatch.Alarm
# alarm2: cloudwatch.Alarm
# alarm3: cloudwatch.Alarm
# alarm4: cloudwatch.Alarm


alarm_rule = cloudwatch.AlarmRule.any_of(
    cloudwatch.AlarmRule.all_of(
        cloudwatch.AlarmRule.any_of(alarm1,
            cloudwatch.AlarmRule.from_alarm(alarm2, cloudwatch.AlarmState.OK), alarm3),
        cloudwatch.AlarmRule.not(cloudwatch.AlarmRule.from_alarm(alarm4, cloudwatch.AlarmState.INSUFFICIENT_DATA))),
    cloudwatch.AlarmRule.from_boolean(False))

cloudwatch.CompositeAlarm(self, "MyAwesomeCompositeAlarm",
    alarm_rule=alarm_rule
)
```

### A note on units

In CloudWatch, Metrics datums are emitted with units, such as `seconds` or
`bytes`. When `Metric` objects are given a `unit` attribute, it will be used to
*filter* the stream of metric datums for datums emitted using the same `unit`
attribute.

In particular, the `unit` field is *not* used to rescale datums or alarm threshold
values (for example, it cannot be used to specify an alarm threshold in
*Megabytes* if the metric stream is being emitted as *bytes*).

You almost certainly don't want to specify the `unit` property when creating
`Metric` objects (which will retrieve all datums regardless of their unit),
unless you have very specific requirements. Note that in any case, CloudWatch
only supports filtering by `unit` for Alarms, not in Dashboard graphs.

Please see the following GitHub issue for a discussion on real unit
calculations in CDK: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/5595

## Dashboards

Dashboards are set of Widgets stored server-side which can be accessed quickly
from the AWS console. Available widgets are graphs of a metric over time, the
current value of a metric, or a static piece of Markdown which explains what the
graphs mean.

The following widgets are available:

* `GraphWidget` -- shows any number of metrics on both the left and right
  vertical axes.
* `AlarmWidget` -- shows the graph and alarm line for a single alarm.
* `SingleValueWidget` -- shows the current value of a set of metrics.
* `TextWidget` -- shows some static Markdown.
* `AlarmStatusWidget` -- shows the status of your alarms in a grid view.

### Graph widget

A graph widget can display any number of metrics on either the `left` or
`right` vertical axis:

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard
# execution_count_metric: cloudwatch.Metric
# error_count_metric: cloudwatch.Metric


dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.GraphWidget(
    title="Executions vs error rate",

    left=[execution_count_metric],

    right=[error_count_metric.with(
        statistic="average",
        label="Error rate",
        color=cloudwatch.Color.GREEN
    )]
))
```

Using the methods `addLeftMetric()` and `addRightMetric()` you can add metrics to a graph widget later on.

Graph widgets can also display annotations attached to the left or the right y-axis.

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard


dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.GraphWidget(
    # ...

    left_annotations=[cloudwatch.HorizontalAnnotation(value=1800, label=Duration.minutes(30).to_human_string(), color=cloudwatch.Color.RED), cloudwatch.HorizontalAnnotation(value=3600, label="1 hour", color="#2ca02c")
    ]
))
```

The graph legend can be adjusted from the default position at bottom of the widget.

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard


dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.GraphWidget(
    # ...

    legend_position=cloudwatch.LegendPosition.RIGHT
))
```

The graph can publish live data within the last minute that has not been fully aggregated.

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard


dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.GraphWidget(
    # ...

    live_data=True
))
```

The graph view can be changed from default 'timeSeries' to 'bar' or 'pie'.

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard


dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.GraphWidget(
    # ...

    view=cloudwatch.GraphWidgetView.BAR
))
```

### Alarm widget

An alarm widget shows the graph and the alarm line of a single alarm:

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard
# error_alarm: cloudwatch.Alarm


dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.AlarmWidget(
    title="Errors",
    alarm=error_alarm
))
```

### Single value widget

A single-value widget shows the latest value of a set of metrics (as opposed
to a graph of the value over time):

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard
# visitor_count: cloudwatch.Metric
# purchase_count: cloudwatch.Metric


dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.SingleValueWidget(
    metrics=[visitor_count, purchase_count]
))
```

Show as many digits as can fit, before rounding.

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard


dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.SingleValueWidget(
    metrics=[],

    full_precision=True
))
```

### Text widget

A text widget shows an arbitrary piece of MarkDown. Use this to add explanations
to your dashboard:

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard


dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.TextWidget(
    markdown="# Key Performance Indicators"
))
```

### Alarm Status widget

An alarm status widget displays instantly the status of any type of alarms and gives the
ability to aggregate one or more alarms together in a small surface.

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard
# error_alarm: cloudwatch.Alarm


dashboard.add_widgets(
    cloudwatch.AlarmStatusWidget(
        alarms=[error_alarm]
    ))
```

An alarm status widget only showing firing alarms, sorted by state and timestamp:

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard
# error_alarm: cloudwatch.Alarm


dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.AlarmStatusWidget(
    title="Errors",
    alarms=[error_alarm],
    sort_by=cloudwatch.AlarmStatusWidgetSortBy.STATE_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP,
    states=[cloudwatch.AlarmState.ALARM]
))
```

### Query results widget

A `LogQueryWidget` shows the results of a query from Logs Insights:

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard


dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.LogQueryWidget(
    log_group_names=["my-log-group"],
    view=cloudwatch.LogQueryVisualizationType.TABLE,
    # The lines will be automatically combined using '\n|'.
    query_lines=["fields @message", "filter @message like /Error/"
    ]
))
```

### Custom widget

A `CustomWidget` shows the result of an AWS Lambda function:

```python
# dashboard: cloudwatch.Dashboard


# Import or create a lambda function
fn = lambda_.Function.from_function_arn(dashboard, "Function", "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:MyFn")

dashboard.add_widgets(cloudwatch.CustomWidget(
    function_arn=fn.function_arn,
    title="My lambda baked widget"
))
```

You can learn more about custom widgets in the [Amazon Cloudwatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_custom_widget_dashboard.html).

### Dashboard Layout

The widgets on a dashboard are visually laid out in a grid that is 24 columns
wide. Normally you specify X and Y coordinates for the widgets on a Dashboard,
but because this is inconvenient to do manually, the library contains a simple
layout system to help you lay out your dashboards the way you want them to.

Widgets have a `width` and `height` property, and they will be automatically
laid out either horizontally or vertically stacked to fill out the available
space.

Widgets are added to a Dashboard by calling `add(widget1, widget2, ...)`.
Widgets given in the same call will be laid out horizontally. Widgets given
in different calls will be laid out vertically. To make more complex layouts,
you can use the following widgets to pack widgets together in different ways:

* `Column`: stack two or more widgets vertically.
* `Row`: lay out two or more widgets horizontally.
* `Spacer`: take up empty space

        :param scope: - scope in which this resource is defined.
        :param id: - scoped id of the resource.
        :param comparison_operator: The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold. The specified statistic value is used as the first operand. You can specify the following values: ``GreaterThanThreshold`` , ``GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold`` , ``LessThanThreshold`` , or ``LessThanOrEqualToThreshold`` .
        :param evaluation_periods: The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold. If you are setting an alarm that requires that a number of consecutive data points be breaching to trigger the alarm, this value specifies that number. If you are setting an "M out of N" alarm, this value is the N, and ``DatapointsToAlarm`` is the M. For more information, see `Evaluating an Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarm-evaluation>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .
        :param actions_enabled: Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm state. The default is TRUE.
        :param alarm_actions: The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an ALARM state from any other state. Specify each action as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information about creating alarms and the actions that you can specify, see `PutMetricAlarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutMetricAlarm.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch API Reference* .
        :param alarm_description: The description of the alarm.
        :param alarm_name: The name of the alarm. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the alarm name. .. epigraph:: If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.
        :param datapoints_to_alarm: The number of datapoints that must be breaching to trigger the alarm. This is used only if you are setting an "M out of N" alarm. In that case, this value is the M, and the value that you set for ``EvaluationPeriods`` is the N value. For more information, see `Evaluating an Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarm-evaluation>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* . If you omit this parameter, CloudWatch uses the same value here that you set for ``EvaluationPeriods`` , and the alarm goes to alarm state if that many consecutive periods are breaching.
        :param dimensions: The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify ``Dimensions`` . Instead, you use ``Metrics`` .
        :param evaluate_low_sample_count_percentile: Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If ``ignore`` , the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If ``evaluate`` or this parameter is not used, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available.
        :param extended_statistic: The percentile statistic for the metric associated with the alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100. For an alarm based on a metric, you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic`` but not both. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify ``ExtendedStatistic`` . Instead, you use ``Metrics`` .
        :param insufficient_data_actions: The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
        :param metric_name: The name of the metric associated with the alarm. This is required for an alarm based on a metric. For an alarm based on a math expression, you use ``Metrics`` instead and you can't specify ``MetricName`` .
        :param metrics: An array that enables you to create an alarm based on the result of a metric math expression. Each item in the array either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression. If you specify the ``Metrics`` parameter, you cannot specify ``MetricName`` , ``Dimensions`` , ``Period`` , ``Namespace`` , ``Statistic`` , ``ExtendedStatistic`` , or ``Unit`` .
        :param namespace: The namespace of the metric associated with the alarm. This is required for an alarm based on a metric. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify ``Namespace`` and you use ``Metrics`` instead. For a list of namespaces for metrics from AWS services, see `AWS Services That Publish CloudWatch Metrics. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html>`_
        :param ok_actions: The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the ``OK`` state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
        :param period: The period, in seconds, over which the statistic is applied. This is required for an alarm based on a metric. Valid values are 10, 30, 60, and any multiple of 60. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify ``Period`` , and instead you use the ``Metrics`` parameter. *Minimum:* 10
        :param statistic: The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ``ExtendedStatistic`` . For an alarm based on a metric, you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic`` but not both. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify ``Statistic`` . Instead, you use ``Metrics`` .
        :param threshold: The value to compare with the specified statistic.
        :param threshold_metric_id: In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is the ID of the ``ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND`` function used as the threshold for the alarm.
        :param treat_missing_data: Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. Valid values are ``breaching`` , ``notBreaching`` , ``ignore`` , and ``missing`` . For more information, see `Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms Treat Missing Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-missing-data>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* . If you omit this parameter, the default behavior of ``missing`` is used.
        :param unit: The unit of the metric associated with the alarm. Specify this only if you are creating an alarm based on a single metric. Do not specify this if you are specifying a ``Metrics`` array. You can specify the following values: Seconds, Microseconds, Milliseconds, Bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes, Bits, Kilobits, Megabits, Gigabits, Terabits, Percent, Count, Bytes/Second, Kilobytes/Second, Megabytes/Second, Gigabytes/Second, Terabytes/Second, Bits/Second, Kilobits/Second, Megabits/Second, Gigabits/Second, Terabits/Second, Count/Second, or None.

            :param id: A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData`` . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.
            :param account_id: The ID of the account where the metrics are located, if this is a cross-account alarm.
            :param expression: The math expression to be performed on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression.

For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

            :param label: A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If ``Label`` is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.
            :param metric_stat: The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data. Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.
            :param period: The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second`` .
            :param return_data: This option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. When you create an alarm based on a metric math expression, specify ``True`` for this value for only the one math expression that the alarm is based on. You must specify ``False`` for ``ReturnData`` for all the other metrics and expressions used in the alarm. This field is required.

        :param actions_enabled: Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm state. The default is TRUE.
        :param alarm_actions: The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an ALARM state from any other state. Specify each action as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information about creating alarms and the actions that you can specify, see `PutMetricAlarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutMetricAlarm.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch API Reference* .
        :param alarm_description: The description of the alarm.
        :param alarm_name: The name of the alarm. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the alarm name. .. epigraph:: If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.
        :param datapoints_to_alarm: The number of datapoints that must be breaching to trigger the alarm. This is used only if you are setting an "M out of N" alarm. In that case, this value is the M, and the value that you set for ``EvaluationPeriods`` is the N value. For more information, see `Evaluating an Alarm <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarm-evaluation>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* . If you omit this parameter, CloudWatch uses the same value here that you set for ``EvaluationPeriods`` , and the alarm goes to alarm state if that many consecutive periods are breaching.
        :param dimensions: The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify ``Dimensions`` . Instead, you use ``Metrics`` .
        :param evaluate_low_sample_count_percentile: Used only for alarms based on percentiles. If ``ignore`` , the alarm state does not change during periods with too few data points to be statistically significant. If ``evaluate`` or this parameter is not used, the alarm is always evaluated and possibly changes state no matter how many data points are available.
        :param extended_statistic: The percentile statistic for the metric associated with the alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100. For an alarm based on a metric, you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic`` but not both. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify ``ExtendedStatistic`` . Instead, you use ``Metrics`` .
        :param insufficient_data_actions: The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA`` state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
        :param metric_name: The name of the metric associated with the alarm. This is required for an alarm based on a metric. For an alarm based on a math expression, you use ``Metrics`` instead and you can't specify ``MetricName`` .
        :param metrics: An array that enables you to create an alarm based on the result of a metric math expression. Each item in the array either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression. If you specify the ``Metrics`` parameter, you cannot specify ``MetricName`` , ``Dimensions`` , ``Period`` , ``Namespace`` , ``Statistic`` , ``ExtendedStatistic`` , or ``Unit`` .
        :param namespace: The namespace of the metric associated with the alarm. This is required for an alarm based on a metric. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify ``Namespace`` and you use ``Metrics`` instead. For a list of namespaces for metrics from AWS services, see `AWS Services That Publish CloudWatch Metrics. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html>`_
        :param ok_actions: The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the ``OK`` state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
        :param period: The period, in seconds, over which the statistic is applied. This is required for an alarm based on a metric. Valid values are 10, 30, 60, and any multiple of 60. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify ``Period`` , and instead you use the ``Metrics`` parameter. *Minimum:* 10
        :param statistic: The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ``ExtendedStatistic`` . For an alarm based on a metric, you must specify either ``Statistic`` or ``ExtendedStatistic`` but not both. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify ``Statistic`` . Instead, you use ``Metrics`` .
        :param threshold: The value to compare with the specified statistic.
        :param threshold_metric_id: In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is the ID of the ``ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND`` function used as the threshold for the alarm.
        :param treat_missing_data: Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. Valid values are ``breaching`` , ``notBreaching`` , ``ignore`` , and ``missing`` . For more information, see `Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms Treat Missing Data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarms-and-missing-data>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* . If you omit this parameter, the default behavior of ``missing`` is used.
        :param unit: The unit of the metric associated with the alarm. Specify this only if you are creating an alarm based on a single metric. Do not specify this if you are specifying a ``Metrics`` array. You can specify the following values: Seconds, Microseconds, Milliseconds, Bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes, Bits, Kilobits, Megabits, Gigabits, Terabits, Percent, Count, Bytes/Second, Kilobytes/Second, Megabytes/Second, Gigabytes/Second, Terabytes/Second, Bits/Second, Kilobits/Second, Megabits/Second, Gigabits/Second, Terabits/Second, Count/Second, or None.

            '''This structure is used in both ``GetMetricData`` and ``PutMetricAlarm`` .

            The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.

            When used in ``GetMetricData`` , it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a Metrics Insights query or a math expression. A single ``GetMetricData`` call can include up to 500 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures.

            When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each ``MetricDataQuery`` in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single ``PutMetricAlarm`` call can include up to 20 ``MetricDataQuery`` structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a ``MetricStat`` parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the ``Expression`` parameter to perform a math expression. Of those ``Expression`` structures, one must have ``true`` as the value for ``ReturnData`` . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.

            Any expression used in a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation must return a single time series. For more information, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .

            Some of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a ``GetMetricData`` operation or a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.

            :param id: A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to ``GetMetricData`` . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.
            :param account_id: The ID of the account where the metrics are located. If you are performing a ``GetMetricData`` operation in a monitoring account, use this to specify which account to retrieve this metric from. If you are performing a ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, use this to specify which account contains the metric that the alarm is watching.
            :param expression: This field can contain either a Metrics Insights query, or a metric math expression to be performed on the returned data. For more information about Metrics Insights queries, see `Metrics Insights query components and syntax <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-metrics-insights-querylanguage>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* . A math expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see `Metric Math Syntax and Functions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* . Within each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.
            :param label: A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default. You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see `Using Dynamic Labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`_ .
            :param metric_stat: The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data. Within one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` but not both.
            :param period: The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` operation that includes a ``StorageResolution of 1 second`` .
            :param return_data: When used in ``GetMetricData`` , this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify ``false`` . If you omit this, the default of ``true`` is used. When used in ``PutMetricAlarm`` , specify ``true`` for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same ``PutMetricAlarm`` operation, specify ``ReturnData`` as False.

For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a ``PutMetricData`` call that includes a ``StorageResolution`` of 1 second. If the ``StartTime`` parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned: - Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute). - Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes). - Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

            :param unit: When you are using a ``Put`` operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric. In a ``Get`` operation, if you omit ``Unit`` then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

    '''A CloudFormation ``AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm``.

    The ``AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm`` type creates or updates a composite alarm. When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are met.

    The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include metric alarms and other composite alarms.

    Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM state.

    Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms are notifying SNS topics.

    When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to INSUFFICIENT_DATA. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the only time that the alarm can be in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.

    When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

For each alarm that you reference, you designate a function that specifies whether that alarm needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. You can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple functions in a single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the functions in your expression. You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be evaluated. Functions can include the following: - ALARM("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in ALARM state. - OK("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK state. - INSUFFICIENT_DATA("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. - TRUE always evaluates to TRUE. - FALSE always evaluates to FALSE. TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex AlarmRule structure, and for testing your alarm actions.

        For each alarm that you reference, you designate a function that specifies whether that alarm needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. You can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple functions in a single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the functions in your expression.

        You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be evaluated.

        Functions can include the following:

        - ALARM("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in ALARM state.
        - OK("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK state.
        - INSUFFICIENT_DATA("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.
        - TRUE always evaluates to TRUE.
        - FALSE always evaluates to FALSE.

        TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex AlarmRule structure, and for testing your alarm actions.

        - INSUFFICIENT_DATA("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.
        - TRUE always evaluates to TRUE.
        - FALSE always evaluates to FALSE.

        TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex AlarmRule structure, and for testing your alarm actions.

    Creates or updates a metric stream. Metrics streams can automatically stream CloudWatch metrics to AWS destinations including Amazon S3 and to many third-party solutions. For more information, see `Metric streams <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html>`_ .

    To create a metric stream, you must be logged on to an account that has the ``iam:PassRole`` permission and either the *CloudWatchFullAccess* policy or the ``cloudwatch:PutMetricStream`` permission.

    When you create or update a metric stream, you choose one of the following:

    - Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account.
    - Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account, except for the namespaces that you list in ``ExcludeFilters`` .
    - Stream metrics from only the metric namespaces that you list in ``IncludeFilters`` .

    When you create a metric stream, the stream is created in the ``running`` state. If you update an existing metric stream, the state does not change.

    If you create a metric stream in an account that has been set up as a monitoring account in CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can choose whether to include metrics from linked source accounts in the metric stream.

You can use this parameter to have the metric stream also send additional statistics in the stream. This array can have up to 100 members. For each entry in this array, you specify one or more metrics and the list of additional statistics to stream for those metrics.

You cannot specify both ``IncludeFilters`` and ``ExcludeFilters`` in the same metric stream. When you modify the ``IncludeFilters`` or ``ExcludeFilters`` of an existing metric stream in any way, the metric stream is effectively restarted, so after such a change you will get only the datapoints that have a timestamp after the time of the update.

        :param statistics_configurations: By default, a metric stream always sends the MAX, MIN, SUM, and SAMPLECOUNT statistics for each metric that is streamed. You can use this parameter to have the metric stream also send additional statistics in the stream. This array can have up to 100 members. For each entry in this array, you specify one or more metrics and the list of additional statistics to stream for those metrics. The additional statistics that you can stream depend on the stream's ``OutputFormat`` . If the ``OutputFormat`` is ``json`` , you can stream any additional statistic that is supported by CloudWatch , listed in `CloudWatch statistics definitions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Statistics-definitions.html.html>`_ . If the ``OutputFormat`` is ``opentelemetry0`` .7, you can stream percentile statistics *(p??)* .

    The math expression is a combination of an expression (x+y) and metrics to apply expression on.
    It also contains metadata which is used only in graphs, such as color and label.
    It makes sense to embed this in here, so that compound constructs can attach
    that metadata to metrics they expose.

    MathExpression can also be used for search expressions. In this case,
    it also optionally accepts a searchRegion and searchAccount property for cross-environment
    search expressions.
